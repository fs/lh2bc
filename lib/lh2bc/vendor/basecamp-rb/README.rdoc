== DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby gem for working with the Basecamp web-services API.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:


== SYNOPSIS:

The first thing you need to do is establish a connection to Basecamp. This
requires your Basecamp site address and your login credentials. Example:
Basecamp::Base.establish_connection!('your.grouphub.com', 'login', 'password')

m = Basecamp::Message.find(8675309)
m.title # => 'Jenny'

>> Creating a Resource
  
  m = Basecamp::Message.new(:project_id => 1037)
  m.category_id = 7301
  m.title = 'Message in a bottle'
  m.body = 'Another lonely day, with no one here but me'
  m.save # => true

>> Updating a Resource

  m = Basecamp::Message.find(8675309)
  m.body = 'Changed'
  m.save # => true
 
>> Deleting a Resource

  Basecamp::Message.delete(1037)

>> Using the non-REST inteface

# The non-REST interface is accessed via instance methods on the Basecamp
# class. Ensure you've established a connection, then create a new Basecamp
# instance and call methods on it. Examples:

  basecamp = Basecamp::Base.new

  basecamp.projects.length      # => 5
  basecamp.person(93832)        # => #<Record(person)..>
  basecamp.file_categories(123) # => [#<Record(file-category)>,#<Record..>]

# Object attributes are accessible as methods. Example:

  person = basecamp.person(93832)
  person.first_name # => "Jason"
